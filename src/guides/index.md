# Guides

You know when you have a problem, and go to all the effort and research of solving it. Only to find yourself having the same problem sometime later, and all you remember is that you've solved the problem before, but now you can't remember how?

These pages are recordings of those! Reminders so I don't forget.

You might find them useful, or you might find them completely irrelevant.
