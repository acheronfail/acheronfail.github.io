This is just a few "nuggets of wisdom" I've come across. Useful to me, maybe not to you.

## Self-improvement

> Good judgement comes from experience.
>
> Experience comes from bad judgement.

> If you don't fail, you fail to succeed.

> The world is what you make it.
>
> And it all starts, with what you make of yourself.

> Act, don't react.

> The embarrassed person cannot learn.

## Reaching out

> The world is full of lonely people afraid to make the first move.

## Working together

> If you want to go fast, go alone.
>
> If you want to go far, go together.

> Code is how you treat your co-workers.

## Mentoring

> First, teach someone the steps.
>
> Next, teach them to see the patterns in it.
>
> Finally, teach them to look for outcomes, using the patterns they know.

> Anyone can learn anything;
>
> Some of us just need more time than others do.

## Other

> Laziness isn't about inaction, it's about optimal action.
